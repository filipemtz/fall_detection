# Fall Detection with Machine Learning

The project compares machine learning algorithms in the task of predicting the activity a person is performing given accelerations and angular velocities measured by  accelerometers positioned in the ankle, right pocket, belt, neck and wrist. In particular, an important goal in the task is to identify if the person felt. Given enough work (the project is a prototype), such solution could be used in health monitoring systems for detecting hazardous events.
